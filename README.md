# Acrome BBT Maze Solver

This repository contains an example of a maze solver using reinforcement learning with the Acrome BBT platform. The project demonstrates how to train an agent to navigate a maze environment using reinforcement learning algorithms and test the trained model on Acrome BBT hardware in real-time.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Train an agent using modern RL techniques to solve a maze.
- **Integration with Acrome BBT**: Test your maze solver with Acrome BBT hardware.
- **Simulation and Visualization**: Simulate the maze environment and visualize results using OpenAI Gym and Matplotlib.

## Installation

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
